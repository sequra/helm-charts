The [European General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr-info.eu/) (GDPR) enforces us to keep sensitive information safe and secure. This document describes the process to identify and classify sensitive information in our applications.

This is a legal requirement that we must comply with. It is not a technical requirement, but it is a requirement that we must comply with in order to minimize the risk of a security breach and fines from the European Union.

To fulfill that requirement, we are going to use `docs/sensitive_data.yaml` file in each repository. This file will contain a list of sensitive information that the application handles.
